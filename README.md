# GIF Finder

A webapplication that allows users to search for and save GIFs. The GIFs are provided by GIPHY's API and library of GIFs. 
The content rating is set to R so please be aware of what your search results could return. <br />

This webapp could be incorporated into a social forum site for people to find and share GIFs that they enjoy. This would allow not only discourse but the display of emotion and humor through GIFs.

## Unsolved Problems
1) Working with MUI CSS and normal CSS to try and make the favorites page stay in scope of view.
2) dynamically generating new columns as favorites page gets more populated.

## Future Enhancements
1) Storing the data on a DB instead of local storage so it is more permanent.
2) Improving MUI styling to present a theme.
3) Using both Google's Tenor and GIPHY APIs so that the user has access to the two largest GIF repositories.
